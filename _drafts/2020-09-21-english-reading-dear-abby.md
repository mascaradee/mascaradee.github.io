## Dear abby

### Woman Planning Future May Have Competition for Widower

Dear abby: A friend's wife died six months ago after a 10 year battle with cancer.
He was her faithful caretaker, as she was mostly homebound and bedridden.
He told me previously that he has had a female friend for the last four years.
He didn't say, but I think she comes "with benefits"(i.e., they have been intimate).
Her office and his workplace regularly interact, and he knows her family and her kids.
He likes me, and I like him. During this initial grief period -- perhaps even for a year --
I wish to only be friends, and I have told him we are not going to be intimate anytime soon.
As his grief lessens, it is possible that he and I may eventually date. But I don't feel good about his female friends,
and I wouldn't want her in our space at all, not even as a casual friend.
If they have been lovers, I would want him to cut All ties with her.

Abby, how likely is a widower to carry forward the (likely) mistress he had
during the wife's protracted illness? -- WAITING IN THE WINGS

Dear WAITING: Very likely! Although I wish you good hunting, you may be four years too late to bag this buck.

 - widower: 홀아비
 - caretaker : 다른 사람을 돌보는 사람, 간병인
 - homebound : 집에 틀어박힌
 - bedridden : 아파서 누워 있는, 자리보전을 하고 있는
 - intimate : 친밀한, (성적으로)사적인
 - interact : 소통하다, 교류하다
 - lessen : 줄다, 줄이다.
 - likely : ~ 할것 같은
 - carry forward : 다음 장으로 이월하다.
 - protracted : 오래 끈, 오래 계속된
 - very likely : 그럴 가능성이 있음

### Mom wants to be present for birth of first grandchild

Dear Abby: My 28-year-old daughter is having our first grandchild.
My daughter and I have a good relationship, but she doesn't want me to be around
when she goes into labor.
All her life I have been the most loving and caring mother I could be to her.
She has a great husband. Should I take it personally that she doesn't want me there
when she goes into labor?
I have waited a long time to be a grandmother. I feel she should be happy to have me around.
I'm deeply hurt that she won't let me be with her during this beauriful moment in her life.
Whtat do you think? -- Saddened in oregon

Dear Saddened: This isn't about you, and I urge you not to personalize this as you are doing.
Childbirth may, indeed, be a "beautiful moment", but it is also a challenge.
This challenge is one your daughter may prefer to face with her husband at her side --
if even he is allowed to be there because of the pandemic. There will be plenty of beautifu moments
you can share with your grandchild in the future, so concentrate on those.

- labor : 분만
- Childbirth : 출산, 분만


### College reunion brings thoughts of old times

Dear Abby: I have stayed in contact with my college friends, but sad to say,
many of my fellow students are now gone for good.
I went to a reunion and met classmates I was close to back in the 1960s.
How circumstances and personalities have changed.
Do you believe that once a person makes a move, either out of school or a job,
that it's all over? You can't go back and relive old times, and if you return to
the community, it isn't the same as if you never left? -- Sentimental in sanfrancisco

Dear Sentimental: Time marches on, and people often grow and change as they mature.
Some -- not all -- people maintain childhood and college friendships into their senior years.
But geographical distance can cause those ties to loosen.
Although we can't relive the old times, we can reminisce. But as the old saying goes,
we can't go home again.

- stay : remain
- fellow : 동년배
- for good : 영원히
- it's all over : 이제는 틀렸다. 이제 끝장났다.
- relive : 다시 체험하다.
- march on : 빨리 지나가다.
- mature : 어른이 되다
- maintain : 유지하다, 지키다.
- loosen : 느슨하게 하다.
- reminisce  [ˌremɪˈnɪs] : 추억에 잠기다, 회상에 잠기다.
- as the old saying goes : 옛말에
