I think it's time to make me good partner.  
How do we do it?  
Is there ~farelike~ **a pill** I can take or something I could ~bake~ **vape**?

It's the good place you can get anything you want at any time.  
and you chose a chalkboard?  
what are you reading?
the ~matter physics~ **Metaphysics of** moral**s** ~manual~ by **Immanuel** Kant  
It's a ~tridis only you start it free conditions~   **treatise on the aesthetic preconditions**
~my under~ **of the mind's** receptivity ~a~ **to** duty  
**It's** a book on how to act good   
oh, great, so  you **'ve** decieded **to** help me  
I don't know, there is a thousand questions.  
Is there a moral ~and parative~ **imperative** to help you?  
do I have a great**er** obligation to my community  
are you taking someone else**'s** spot, someone who deserves to be here

You are the most ~selfus~ **self-obsessed** person  I have **ever** met.

**Okay** this is my fear about **you** Eleanor .  
you are too selfish to ever be a good person.
