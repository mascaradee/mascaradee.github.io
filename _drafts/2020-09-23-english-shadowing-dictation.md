## Good Place

### episod 1-2

So this is how it works.
the good place is devided in**to** distinct neighborhoods.
each one contains exactly 322 people **who** have been perfectly selected
to blend together into a blissful harmonic balance
Do all the neighborhoods look like this?
no every neighborhood is unique, some have warm weather,some cold, some are cities, some farmland
but ~~an~~ **in** each one every blade of grass, every ladybug, every detail has been precisely designed and calibrate**d** ~~it~~ for its residents.
There is a lot of prozen yogurt places .
yeah that's one thing we put **in** all the neighborhoods.
people love prozen yogurt. I don't know what to tell you.
you're gonna have **a** millon more questions I know.
**for** right now. better ~~to~~ grab a seat. movie's about to begin.
ah, hello everyone and welcome to your first day in the afterlife.
you were all simply put good people.
but how do we know that you were good? how are we sure?
During your time on earth everyone of your actions ~~have~~ **had** a positive or a negative value.
depending on how much good or bad that action put ~~you~~ in**to** the universe.
every sandwich you ate, every time you bought a magazine, every single thing you did
had an effect that rippled out over time.
and ~ultermately~ **ultimately** created some amount of good or bad.
you know how some people pull ~on~ **into** the breakdown lane
when ~thier's~ **there's** traffic?
**and** they think to themselves ah who cares? no one's watching
we were watching
suprise!
anyway, when your time on earth has ended
we calculate the total value of your life
using our perfectly accurate measuring system
only the people with the very highest scores
the true cream of the crop
get to come here to the good place.
what happens to everyone else you ask?
don't worry about it.
the point is you are here because you lived one of the very best lives
that could be lived.
and you won't be alone. your true soulmate is here too.
that's right. soulmates are real
one of the other people in your neighborhood
is your actual soulmate and you'll spend ~eternally~ **eternity** together.
so welcome to eternal happiness
welcome to the good place.
