## Good Place

### episod 2-4
Hey guys. OK Eleanor reminder  
we switched **to** a rotating system  
for choosing a designated driver and it's your turn  
got it  
~fool this closure~ **Full disclosure** I forget we~'re~ **were** doing ~as~ **this** new system   
I~'ve~ got **off** ~for~ early I've been here for  ~half~ **about** an hour  
and I'am already pretty drunk
someone else **will** do it. Good ~girl~ **call**  
guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant ~rue fall~ loophole
in the system I ~accidently~ **accidentally** discovered  
beepbeep

I ~coverly mashmellow~ **can't believe they've managed to mix** 1 million flavors together  
**and yet,** somehow I can taste each individual one  
It's remarkable  
I~'ve~ got no flavor  
~so I'm~ **It's all I** deserve~d~ really. No.  
look I appreciate you try**ing** to cheer me up  
~but by~ **I** really do **but** you don't understand  
this was the very first neiborhood that I~'ve~ got to design  
~that~ **it** was my ~chest~ **chance to prove** ~proof of~ myself **and now** I've blown it  
you know sometimes  a ~floor~ **flaw can** make something even more beuatiful  
like **with** Cindy Crawford **and how** ~that~ short **she** is  
Oh, Tahani, If I made one tiny mistake in my design  
**if** there is a single gli**t**ch ~on~ **in** the system  
**if** even one blade of grass is angled ~the~ **a** fraction of **a** degree of**f**  
the whole neighborhood is compromised  
~who's~ **whose** dog is that?  
guys, ~who's~ **whose** dog is that?  
~who's~ **whose** dog is that?  
see this is one of those gli**t**ches ~that~ I was talking about  
nice try, puppy  
~how's~ **That was a** close one  
Teacup  
Have you seen my dog?  
should**n't these be** ~we have~ magical trash ~bins~ **bags**?  
five more minutes flyers  
five more minutes. oh man really  
Janet I'm finished **with** ~the~ cleanup and I'm ready to fly  
How do I start? hop on **the** launch pad  
~In conjucnt imagine~ **and conjure an image** that ~you~ bring**s** ~to~ **you** pure joy  
some people think of the**ir** wedding day or ~some~ favorite vacation spot  
people ~view king~ **puking** on roller co**a**sters  
people ~view king~ **puking** on roller co**a**sters
It's working  
ow, what the fork  
Janet any chance this is a schedule**ed** trash strom?  
So here is **the** situation ~have either~ **Pevita**  
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun  
but I got her back  
everything~s he is~ **seems** fine  
teacup ~then~ **thank** goodness ~are you~ **you're** ok  
everyone it is merely a ~constructive~ **construct of a** dog  
it feel no pain or joy or ~alarm~ **love**  
teacup dosen't love me?  
oh, oh nononono it definitely feels love  
do **you** actually want ~to~ **a** dog that~'s~ **loves** you a little bit more  
because I can kick her right back into the sun  
and get you another one just like that  
No, oh boy, I'm making things worse  
ok, all right, that's all right, breath**e breathe Do you** you breath**e**  
**if you do, then** just breath**e**  
**cause** everthing is fine, Michael it's fine  
It's raining garbage run.  
~oh I'm the straight~ **No no no I'm gonna run this way**  
chidy hey ~what for~ **before** you say anything?  
That's it I just don't want **you** to say anything  
what did you do?  nothing  
It just started raining trash ~on the~ **out of** no where **for** no reason at all  
ok fine fine  
My bag  broke and I ditched the trash   
~in the set up~ **instead of** taking it all **the way to the dumpster** ~of dum store~  
but in my defense  
there were only five minutes left~ed~ in flying  and I wanna go to flying  
how ~was~ **is** thet ~in~ **a** defense? you made a bad choice  
I made a bad choice? we could've ~litterly being~ **literally been**  flying  
and **all**  you wanted to **do was**talk about morals  
I mean ~your leg is~ **you're like** the worst part of superman  
this is relief I can~'t~ stop my ~relibration~ **deliberations**    
You're a selfish person and it is pointless to help you   
you are on your own  
oh man  
how about this trash **storm** ~all~ Gunner?  more cleaning up  to do  
It's a dream come true  
We're Ok  
~he can dive~ **You can't die** here  
come on I mean even you have to admit ~he is a~ **those guys are** phyco
