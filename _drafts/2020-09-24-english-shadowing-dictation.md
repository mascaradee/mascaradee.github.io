that souns about right. what about Florence Nightingale?
~That~ **It** was close but no she didn't make it.
Wow all those amazing people down there it~'s to~ **just** seem**s** so hard to believe
again it's an incredibly selective system.
most people don't make it here.
but you a lawyer, who got innocent people off death row
you're special Eleanor
and By the way, welcome to your new home .
Ah it's perfect isn't it?
you see in the good place every person gets to live in a home ~to~ **that** perfectly match**es** his or her true essense
cool
so I guess that's why my house for example is this adorable little cot**t**age
whereas other people might have homes thst are bigger
like that One
Exactly oh I'm so happy you get it.
As you can see, the interior has been decorated  just as you like it.
in the icelandic primitive style
oh oh uh and of course you love clowns so
I do love clowns.
now let me show you the uh the vedio system here
you can review everything that happened in your life from your point of view.
there we go.
this is your human rights mission to **the** Ukrain**e**
I mean you got **a** ton of point**s** ~of~ **for** that one, **It** really put you over the top
chidi come on in.

cool bring it in man.
now Excuse me I have other people to attend to
so where you fron Chidi?
I was born in Nigiria raised in ~Sinegal~ **Senegal**.

Austraila, Hongkong, Paris
What about you?
uh I was born in ~Phinex~ **Phoenix**, Arizona.
**and** then I ~was in~ **went to** shool in Tempe, Arizona.
and then I moved ~to~ **back to** ~Phinex~ **Phoenix**, Arizona.
Your English is amazing.
oh, I'm actually speaking French, this place just transrate**s** whatever you say
~they~ into a language the other person can understand.
so it's incredible. whoa
and now I want to say this, ok
Eleanor I have spent my entire life ~and~ **in** pursuit of fundamental truth**s** about the Universe
and now we can actually learn about them together  as soulmate**s**.
It's overw**h**elming
Chidi you'll stand by my side no matter what right?
of course I will.
promise me say I promise I'll never betray you for any reason
Eleanor, I swear that I'll never say or do anything to cause you any harm.
Good
Because those aren't my memories.
I wasn's a lowyer, I~'ve~ never went to the Ukrain.
I hate clowns.
There's been a big mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
wait what?
are you sure this isn't you?
yeah man, I'm pretty sure I wasn't a death row lowyer who collected clown~s~ paintings and rescued orphans
they got my name right but nothing else.
I mean, someboby royally forked up.
someboby forked up.
why can't I say fork?
If you're trying to curse you can't here
I guess a lot of people in the neighborhood don't like it here   so it's prohibited
that's bullshirt
so if you are not this person, then who are you?
what did you for a living?
I was in sales
so we sell two products here , nasapro and nasapro silver
we aim **this at** seniors
now ~we~ **you** can't legally call it medicine because it doesn't technically work
and it is technically chalk so what you
you need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine
I get it man, which one is my desk?
so your job was to def**r**aud the elderly
sorry the sick and elderly
but I was good at it.
I was the  top salesperson five year running
ok that's worse.
**I mean** you do get how that's worse right?
**You know** maybe it's a test
maybe if you go to Michael and ~get~ **you** tell him the truth
you'll pass the test and you'll get to stay.
No way. I can't risk going to the bad place.
**ok, well** maybe it's not actually like all that bad.
let's just get some information first. ~let's~ **we'll** ask Janet.
Hey Janet. Hi there How can I help you?
what the fork? who are you?
I'm Janet. I'm the informational assistant here in the good place
she's like this walking database.
You can ask her about the creation of the universe or history.
oh there was a guy who lived in Abondale, Arizona around 2002.
His name was Kevin Paltonic.
Is he gay? No. Really? Huh **I guess** He just didn't want to have sex with me.
That's correct.
But I wasn't **that** into him anyway.
Yes you ~are~ **were**. OK Janet I have a question. OK
What is the bad place like?
Oh, sorry that's the one topic I am not allowed  to tell you about.
I can only play you a brief audio clip of what is happening there right now.
~That~ **The** bear has two mouths.
well it doesn't sound awesome.
Does everyone have a huge house except me?
~Alright~ **all right**, we need a plan.
I ~'d stay to ~ **say we**  just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.
I'm sorry I don't think I can help you   .
I just don't like being dishonest. and I can't advise you to be dishonest either.
come on I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit.
you must've told a few white lies in your life.
I mean what was your job?
I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
mother-forker
I~'v get~ **'m getting a** stomachache. I'm in a perfect utopia.
and I have **a** stomachache. ~It~ **This**'s awful.
I think, I have to tell Michael about this.
Tell Michael about what?
Michael, Hi?
What have you been up to?
Eleanor, Chidi I would like to meet Tahani and Juanyu.
They are soulmate and your next door neighbors.
Hello, can I just say I love your house?
It's just so tiny and cute. It's like a littel child plaything or **like** for family of mice
**or** for a very fancy little dog. I love it it's **just** so sweet and tensy.
Just like you boop.
oh, oh
you booped me.
I did. that's fun.
Tahani and jianyu are having a litte welcome party tonight, **and** they've invited the entire neighborhood.
I simply adore entertaining.
don't I just adore it Jianyu?
oh yes, by the way jianyu here is a buddhist monk you see
and he obeys **a** strict code of silence.
so when you see him smiling and nodding, that's actually his way of jumping up and down with glee
Isn't that right, darling? so **we'll**  see you tonigt?
great. Yes
