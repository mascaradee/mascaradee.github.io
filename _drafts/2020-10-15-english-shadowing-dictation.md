Michael do you know what the best part ~of~ **about** this place is?  
you figure**d** ~it~ out how to make ~it~ **a to** go cup  
that doesn't leak right ~way~ **where** ~seem~**seam** meets the ~leak~ **lid**  
Oh, I'm so glad ~to notice this~ **you noticed**  I~'m so~ **was very** proud of that  
one of the ~hottest from~ **hardest problems**  ~head has salt~ **I had to solve**  
Eleanore I know what you did  
cleaning up the entire neighborhood by yourself  
I knew you~'re~ **were** special but this is proof  
well I was just doing my part you know  and um  
Since I'm special your words I didn't get to fly  
I'm sorry **No, I've had** to ban ~it~ **flying** for 1000 years too many injuries  
one regident hit a ~latin~ **rotting** turkey ~cockies set~ **carcass at**  a 1000miles an hour  
I just ~explored~ **exploded** into **this** fireball of turkey ~flashed~ **flesh and** bones and ~senior~ **sinew**  
anywhere, enjoy your coffee and the cup.  
so I have moved out of my apartment officially  
and into your guest room  
figure**d** it **would** cause less suspici~a~ **o**n ~in~  
**and** make things easier for our good person lessons  
cool, just FYI I'm a very loud snor~ed~ **er**  
and I~'d~ like to drip dry in the nude so ~are you sure prefer~  **eyes to yourself, perv**  
ok fine. now you~'ve~ got a long way to go to ~full~ **pull** this off  
**it** will take hours and hours of studying ethics and moral philosop**h**y    
we're gonna have assignment**s** and  qui**z**zes and  papers    
**it** is gonna be so much fun  
remind me what I'm getting out **of** this again  
you~'ll~ get to avoid **e**ternal damnation  
oh yeah right  
hey I got ~your~ **you a** present what?  
senegal  
that's not a present that's just common ~disionci?~ **decency**  
yeah but I forking ~near that~ **nailed it**
