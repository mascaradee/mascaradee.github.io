## Good Place

### episod 1-1
Eleanor, come on in
Hi, Eleanor. I'm Michael.
How are you today?
I'm great. Thanks for asking.
Oh, one question. Where am I? who are you? and what's going on?
right so you Eleanor shellstroop are dead.
your life on earth has ended
**and** you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe.
cool. cool. I have some questions.
Thought you might.
How **did** I ~~dided~~ **die**?
I don't remember.
yes um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths
we ~~are~~ erase the memory **to allow** for ~~the~~ **a** peaceful transition
are you sure **you** want to hear?
~~alright~~ **all right**. **so** you were in a grocery **store** parking lot.
you dropped a bottle **of** something called lonely gal margarita mix for One
and **when** you bent down to pick it up a long column of shopping carts
that were ~~been returning~~ **being returned** to the shopping carts collection area
rolled out of control **and** plowed right into you.
oof that's how I died? no **sorry** there's more.
you were able to grab on to **the** front of **the** column of ~~the~~ shopping cart
but it'd swept you **right** out into the street
**where** you were struck and killed by a mobile billboard truck advertising
an erectile dysfunction pill called engorgelate
funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive **was an** ex-boyfriend of yours
ok that's .. I get it thank you.
um so who was right?
I mean about all of this.
well let's see Hindus **are** a litte bit right. muslims a litte bit jews, christians, buddhist**s**.
every religion guessed about 5%.
Except Doug Forcett. who's Doug Forcett?
**Well** Doug was a stoner kid who lived in Calgary **during the** 1970s
one night he got really high on mushrooms
and **his** best friend Randy said Hey what do you think happens after we die?
and Doug just launched into this long monologue
**where** he got **like** 92% correct
we couldn't believe what we were hearing.
that's him actually right up there.
he's pretty famous round here
I'm very lucky to have that.
so maybe my biggiest question. am I?
I mean Is this... or
well it's not the heaven or hell idea that you **were** raised on
but generally speaking, in the afterlife
there's a good place and there's a bad place
you're in the good place
you're ok Eleanor
you're in the good place.
well that's good.
sure is
ok let's take a walk shall we?
oh did I have a purse. no I'm dead, right, ok.
