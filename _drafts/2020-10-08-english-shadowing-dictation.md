All right everyone, let's get started.  
Things have settled down, phew.  
So ~hopely~ **hopefully** we ~all open~ **'re off and'** running .  
Welcome to orientation day 2.
Now today we're gonna start with something  
that everyone has always wanted to do  
flying  
now ~trethat?~ **that you're dead** let's ~liberity~ **live a little** right?
ah sorry, Michael. If I might, I was just thinking earlier today in all of the c**h**aos  
large ~swarm~ **swaths** of this neighborhood were ~just~ destroyed  
we ~talk~ **thought** perhaps some **of us could** ~bask the~ volunteer to help ~the~ clean up ~bridle~ **the debris**  
you know, it's ~got~ **quite a** fun ~later fun~ **way to band** together ~is~ **as** a community  
Isn't that right Jianyu?  
Oh, ah yes sorry, for ~there's~ **those of you** who don't know   
My soulmate Jianyu, here is a ~boodhist~ **Buddhist** monk  
he took ~about~ **a vow of** silence that he's still observing    
even here, in the good place.  
~truelyans firing~ **It's truly inspiring**   
well Tahani, it's not really your job to clean up  
but I suppose ~it's~ **there's** no harm ~and few relay~ **if you really** want **to**  
well ~hooray~ **hurrah**, we need about 12 volunteers  
I can't believe all these people are passing on flying  
to pick up garbage all day  
have fun ~nuts~ **nerds**
I'll be ~so on thrilled airline~ **soaring through the air** like a forking bird
Eleanor and I would love to help. ~oh yeah~ **Ah, Hurrah, hurrah, yay**  
dude. you wanna ~verbune and~ **prove you're not** selfish  here is the pefect test  
there is something fun ~if~ **that** you wanna to **do** and **then**
there's something less fun **that** people ~will do it~ **are doing** for ~coming~ **the common** good   
which do you choose?  
Have fun.  
hey, hooray
hey upthere  
having fun? or ~is~ **does** it maybe suck probably?  
**well** I would**n't** ~like to~ call **it** fun  
~I've said~ **I'd say it's like** ~15~ **50** milion~s~ ~tiny~ **simultaneous** orgasm**s**  
but better  
How's ~fine~ **volunteer** ~to~ ga**r**bage pickup?  
about ~per~ **the** same  
Great  
You know this really reminds me **of** my time ~of~ **in** vietnam  
picking up ~mortor showers~ **mortar shells with** my godmother Diana  
~There is~ **Doesn't** really matter ~for~ **of what** she's a princess of. ~some~ **It's not really** important  
Tahani, how goes ~to~ **the** cleaning?  
Oh, swimmingly Michael, **And** I have to say  
this neighborhood ~even~ **that you've** built is truly a ~mount of pieces~ **masterpiece**  
the ~rocks~ **likes of** which I've never seen   
and I've been **to** Johnny Depp's private ~birth santuary~ **bird sanctuary**  
oh well thank you that's very kind of you to ~the saying~ **say**
**but** ~there's~ **it's** also dead wrong.  
this neighborhood is **a** disaster  
see, I must **have** made a mistake somewhere  and **it** ~let~ **led** to all this c**h**aos  
**and now** I'm just ~terrifying~ **terrified** that ~this~ **it** is gonna happenn again  
I'm trying to put a good face **on**
well this face ~did~  **that** I have construct**ed** ~from~ **for** myself  
but the truth is I'm just miserable   
I have to go  
Thank you so much for your service  
um no, powerful people do not handle ~failiar~ **failure** well   
Michael could be heading for **a** total meltdown  
soulmate are you thinking what I'm thinking ?  
~three~ **shoul we** say it at the same time all right, one, two, three  
we must help Michael  
oh you~'re slide~ **sly** devil  
~could~ **You're going to** keep **me** ~you~ **on** my toes are**n't** you?  
all right, come on let's go  
Hey Gunner, Hey Antonio  
Hey Eleanor, isn't this great?  
Oh yeah  
when I thought of the afterlife  
I totally pictured  being **an** unpaid non-flying ~generator~ **janitor**  
us too   
you guy**s** ~is~ **are** so fun just ~brilland is~ **relentlessly** fun  
I keep thinking when **are** they gonna stop being fun   
and the answer is never you'll never gonna stop  
well I have **had** a pretty full day of being selfish  
I**'ve** made some new friends my area's almost ga**r**bage free  
so you**'re** gonna help me figure ~it~ **out** how ~I~ **to** stay right?  
~How~ **Well** that is a really tough question  
~that mostly~ **Most great** ~philasophy~ **philosophers** ~could~ **would** say  
helping you is pointless you can**n't** try to be good  
~that specially~ **especially** when you**r** motivation**s** ~has~ **are** so obviously ~currupted~ **corrupt**  
yeah, but what ~if~ **do** most ~grateful ausopis~ **great philosophers** know   ?  
on the other hand, ~at you start any of~ **Aristotle thought that** moral ~virtual~ **virtue is** something  that you could get better ~it~ **at**. he compared **it** to playing the ~plut~ **flute**  
**The** more you practice~d~, **the** more you improve~d~  
**Aristotle** ~when it startle there~ **that**'s my boy right there he was the best   
I mean ~you~ most people agree he was **the** best one  
so it sounds to  me ~you like an arron board~ **like you are onboard** the help ~on our~ **Eleanr** train  
well I have **narrowed it down to** two possibilities yes and no  
well no worries  
just hit me up when you're done ~way~ **weighing** my life in your hands  
I'll just keep doing what I do best being super consider**ate** ~it~ and selfless
