I don't remember anything specific.

I might not have been a saint but I ...it's **not like I** ~only~ killed anybody
I wasn't an ~asornist~ **arsonist**.
I neve found a wallet outsid of **an** IHOP and thought about returning it
but ~so~ **saw** the owner lived out of state
**so** just took the cash dropped the wallet back on the groud
~I think~  ~it's very~ **Okay that's really** specific
and ~it~ **that** makes me think **that you** definitely ~you~ did do that
all I'm saying is these people might be good
**but** are they really that much better than me?
well I spent half ~of~ my life in Noth Korea fighting for women's rights
and the othere half in Saudi Arabia fighting for Gay~'s~ rights
so we said If **the** UN won't remove those land mines we will
**and** we dug up ~of~ **over a** thousand unexploded land mines
**from** the area surrounding the orphanage
well then he said
you can't give me both your ~kedneys~ **kidneys**. You'll die.
**and** I said but you'll live and I **know** we just met on ~the~ **this** bus ten minutes ago but he ~seems~  **seemed** nice.

Chidi, chidi, chidi?
I'm sorry that you had to deal with this
It's Okay.
It's not though.
do you think anybody cared that I died?
maybe someone did. I don't know.
I was an only child.
my parents were divorced ~to~ when I was a kid.
they were both crummy people so they are probably in the bad place.
maybe they are being used to to**r**ture each other.
It would work.
I bet way more people cared that you died
cause you're a nice person.
You're a nice person chidi anaconda.
Anygonye. Agnocomonga.
Anagonye. say it again. Anagonye. No ~said which is you~ **say what you said** before

Michael, Is that giant terrifying ladybug supposed to be there?
Ah well great question Tahani.
no, no it's not.
I have no idea why ~is in this~ **any of this is** happening ~here~ or How to control it.
should we run away then? Yes.
righto.
Chidi chidi what's going on?
