## Good Place

### episod 1-5

okay, okay we don't know this is because of me.
Eleanor, this place is a perfectly made Swiss watch
and you're a wrench in the gears.
actually you're a hammer just smashing the gears into dust
Oh hang on, not everybody here is perfect, okay.
Tahany is totally condescending and there are a couple of you know chunksters.
oh come on.
No judgement I'm just saying
I'm not the only one with flaws. so how can we be sure ~with~ this is my fault?
you hogged all the shrimp~s~ and now ~the~ **there are** shrimp~s~ flying around
you called Tahani a giraff**e** and now ~the~ **there are** giraff**e**s everywhere
okay fine, turns out ~the~ **there are** many ways to know that ~with~ **it was** me
let's just face it. you don't belong here
well then this system sucks
what one in a millon gets to live in ~the~ paradise
**and** everyone else **is** totured for eternity
come on
I mean I wasn't freaking Gandi, but I was okay.
I was a medium person.
I should get to spend ~etinity~ **eternity** in ~the~ **a** medium **place**
like ~Sincinaty~ **Cincinnati**
everyone who wasn't perfect but wasn't terrible
should get to spend ~etinity~ **eternity**  in Sincinaty~ **Cincinnati**
look apparently **it** doesn't work ~here ???~ **that way**
I'm sorry Eleanor but there is nothing anyone can do
unless..
there is something we can do unless you could teach me
teach you what?
how to be good.
that was your job right? a professor of ethics
no one knew I was **a** problem when I arrived
things only started getting crazy after I was an ash-hole to everyone at the party.euh
You know I'm trying to say~ing~ ash-hole and not ash-hole
I got that. yes.
okay give me a chance let me earn my place here
let me be your ethical ~guinifig~ **guiniea pig**
hey guys, emergency neighborhood meeting now
we'll be right there Michael
If I walk out ~to~ **of** here in ~this~ **these** cloth**e**s I'm toast
My soul is in your hand**s**, soulmate. what's **it** gonna be?
oh, stomachache.
